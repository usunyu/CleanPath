<p>A new smart phone app helps navigate driving with an accurate travel time estimation.</p>

<p>Time and energy are the most important commodities of the 21st century â€“ and traffic congestion wastes both. Our mission is to help drivers find the best path to their destination and avoid unnecessary delays and expenses. We accomplish this by using "predicted traffic patterns" computed based on 3 years of historical traffic sensor data. Cleaparth also adjusts the predicted traffic patterns in real-time by taking into account the travel-delays caused by weather and accidents.</p>

<p>Clearpath is a spin-off company from University of Southern California. The technology behind ClearPath is a result of more than 10 years of research and protected by 3 patents.</p>

<p>Experimental results show that Clearpath yields 18% travel-time savings over Google Map's paths, and travel - time accuracy is 92%. ClearPath received more than $2 million research funding in the last 3 years from variety of industry and federal agencies.</p>
