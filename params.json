Our mission is to help drivers find the best path to their destination and avoid unnecessary delays and expenses. We accomplish this by using \"predicted traffic patterns\" computed based on 3 years of historical traffic sensor data. Cleaparth also adjusts the predicted traffic patterns in real-time by taking into account the travel-delays caused by weather and accidents.\r\n\r\nClearpath is a spin-off company from University of Southern California. The technology behind ClearPath is a result of more than 10 years of research and protected by 3 patents.\r\n\r\nExperimental results show that Clearpath yields 18% travel-time savings over Google Map's paths, and travel - time accuracy is 92%. ClearPath received more than $2 million research funding in the last 3 years from variety of industry and federal agencies.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
